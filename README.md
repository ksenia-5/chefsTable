# chefsTable
 django practice

 ### chefsTable is a fictional restaurant. 
 
 I am creating a website for chefsTable while learning [Django Development Framework](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/home/info) of the [Meta Back-End Professional Certificate track](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-back-end-developer).
 
 My aim is to learn Django so I can deploy ML web applications.
