# chefsTable
 django practice

 ### chefsTable is a fictional restaurant. 
 
 I created a website for a fictional restaurant Little Lemon, a franchise of chefsTable, while completing the [Django Development Framework](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/home/info) course of the [Meta Back-End Professional Certificate track](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-back-end-developer).
 
I am learning Django with aim to deploy simple machine learning models on the web, hoping to get an NLP project online soon.
